Collections
	- An object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.
	- A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections
	
	[Collection Framework]
	- Interfaces - Collection, Set, List, Queue, Deque, Map
	- Implementations - ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet, ArrayDeque, HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap
	- Algorithms - Sorting, Shuffling, Searching, Data Manipulation, Composition, Min/Max
	
	[Benefits]
	- Reduces Programming Effort
	- Increases Program Speed and Quality
	- Allows interoperability among unrelated APIs
	- Reduces effort to learn and to use new APIs
	- Reduces effort to design new APIs
	- Fosters software reuse
	
Generics
	- Stronger type checks at compile time
	- Elimination of casts
	- Enabling programmers to implement generic algorithms

	- Type Parameter Naming Convention
		E - Element (used extensively by the Java Collections Framework)
		K - Key
		N - Number
		T - Type
		V - Value
		S,U,V etc. - 2nd, 3rd, 4th types
		
Reflection
	- An API that represents ("reflects") the classes, interfaces, and objects in the current Java Virtual Machine.
	- Reflection is commonly used by programs which require the ability to examine or modify the runtime behavior of applications running in the Java virtual machine
	[Use cases]
	- Extensibility Features
	- Class Browsers and Visual Development Environments
	- Debuggers and Test Tools

	[Limitations]
	- Performance Overhead
	- Security Restrictions
	- Exposure of Internals
	
Annotations
	-Annotations, a form of metadata, provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself
	
	[Use cases]
	- Information for the compiler
	- Compile-time and deployment-time processing
	- Runtime Processing

Nested/Inner Classes
	- A nested class is a member of its enclosing class.
	- Non-static nested classes (inner classes) have access to other members of the enclosing class, even if they are declared private.
	- Static nested classes do not have access to other members of the enclosing class
	
	[Why Nested Classes]
	- It is a way of logically grouping classes that are only used in one place
	- It increases encapsulation
	- It can lead to more readable and maintainable code
	
	[Types]
	- Static Nested Classes
	- Inner Classes (Non-static)
		- Local Inner Class -> declare an inner class within the body of a method
		- Anonymous Inner Class -> declare an inner class within the body of a method without naming the class
	
Lambda Expressions
	- Lambda expressions enables to treat functionality as method argument, or code as data.
	- Functional Interface -> A functional interface is any interface that contains only one abstract method.
	
Stream APIs
	- Streaming Source
	- Intermediate Operations	-> filter, map, sort, distinct, etc..
	- Termial Operations
		- Reduce Operation -> count, avg, sum, min/max, etc..
		- Collect Operation -> toList, toSet, grouping, etc..

Java I/O
	- An I/O Stream represents an input source or an output destination. A stream can represent many different kinds of sources and destinations, including disk files, devices, other programs, and memory arrays
	- Byte Stream -> Programs use byte streams to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes
	- Character Stream -> Java platform stores character values using Unicode conventions. Character stream I/O automatically translates this internal format to and from the local character set. 
	- Buffered Stream -> Buffered input streams read data from a memory area known as a buffer; the native input API is called only when the buffer is empty. Similarly, buffered output streams write data to a buffer, and the native output API is called only when the buffer is full.
		- Flushing Buffer Stream to sync write with native file sys
	- Scanning and Formatting
	- I/O from command line
	
JDBC API
	- Specification to access RDBMS from Java
	- 4 Types of drivers
	- Steps required to access database
		- Registering database drivers OR creating datasource
		- Get Connection
		- Create Statement
		- Execute Query
		- Access ResultSet
	- RowSet provides more features to access the data on top of Resultset
